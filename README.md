braille-converter
=================

Converts English text to Fully Contracted (Grade 2) Braille. Aims to account for every rule that does not rely on semantic analysis, and even a few that do, but can be roughly approximated. Does not use BRF or any esortic format. It simply uses the Braille code-points of Unicode.
